# Born2beroot
### Description
  > **This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization.**<br>
  You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox)
  under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up
  your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

## Evaluation Process

> You only have to turn in a signature.txt file at the root of your Git repository. You
must paste in it the signature of your machine’s virtual disk. To get this signature, you
first have to open the default installation folder (it is the folder where your VMs are
saved)...
...Then, retrieve the signature from the ".vdi" file (or ".qcow2 for UTM’users) of your
virtual machine in sha1 format.
