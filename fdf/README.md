# FdF
### Description
  > **This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.** <br>
  All programs that you wrote until now were executed in text mode on your terminal. 
  Now, let’s discover something more exciting: how to open a graphics window and draw inside? 
  To start your journey in graphic programming, FdF offers to represent “iron wire” meshing in 3D.
