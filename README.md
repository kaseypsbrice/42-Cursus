Projects from the 42 Cursus to date. Studies commenced **21 February 2022**.
#### Note regarding the following table:
* **CCR** stands for Common Core Rank, it represents what stage you are at in your studies. To validate your studies you must complete Libft(CCR 0). Afterwards, there are 6 CCRs and 5 exams total (exam02-exam06). Each exam will advance you to the subsequent rank.

| Project         | CCR | Summary                                              | Status            |
|-----------------|:---:|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| [Libft](https://github.com/kaseypsbrice/42-Cursus/tree/main/Libft) | 0          | This project is about coding a C library. It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon. | Complete |
| [Born2beroot](https://github.com/kaseypsbrice/42-Cursus/tree/main/Born2beroot) | 1 | This document is a System Administration related exercise. | Complete |
| [ft_printf ](https://github.com/kaseypsbrice/42-Cursus/tree/main/ft_printf)| 1 | The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. | Complete |
| [get_next_line](https://github.com/kaseypsbrice/42-Cursus/tree/main/get_next_line) | 1 | This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. | Complete |
| [minitalk](https://github.com/kaseypsbrice/42-Cursus/tree/main/minitalk) | 2 | The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. | Complete |
| [push_swap](https://github.com/kaseypsbrice/42-Cursus/tree/main/push_swap) | 2 | This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimised data sorting. | Complete |
| [FdF](https://github.com/kaseypsbrice/42-Cursus/tree/main/fdf) | 2 | This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines. | Complete |
